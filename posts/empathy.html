				Empathy is the ability to understand and share the emotions of others. Empathy is a very human part of ourselves. It is the foundation on which we care for everyone and have meaningful relationships, and the driver of innumerable, crucial events in history.
			</div>
			<h2>Caring For Everyone</h2>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				Empathy is thinking about everyone around us right now. It's the small business owners who shut down their restaurants, salons, daycare centers, etc. It's those affected in the food supply chain: farmers left with too much produce, suppliers transporting reduced inventory, and retail markets rationing their foods. It's the students forced to stay home from school and their parents who have to maintain a semblance of calm. It's our elderly citizens, staying in nursing homes and our prisoners, trapped in jails, both of which are COVID hotspots. It's the essential workers working right now to support us. It's the healthcare workers who choose to put us first. It's our citizens marching for change, wondering why police brutality is an afterthought when they aren't safe engaging with the police.
			</div>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				We all have the capacity to care but we tend to reserve it for our friends and family rather than humans we don't know well yet. However our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others, past and present. And by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future. 
			</div>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				We are bound to each other because our society is built on both collaboration. We collaborate across international, national, state, and municipal communities. Imagine a world where nobody opens restaurants, cafes, or shops. It's one where governments don't build public sector infrastructure like libraries, roads, parks, bridges, railroads, postal services or schools. Imagine one where artists, musicians, and writers don't collaborate, share ideas, and create novel genres that define our culture. Imagine if national borders were closed off, and there were restrictions on both travel and trade. That world would not be fun to live in. It's only by caring about each other beyond our immediate responsibilities that we create a better future for everyone. 
			</div>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				We like to think of ourselves as independent entities. However, our personalities are very tied to our environments and families. We are shaped by our families and their choices. We are products of our environments, and we've inherited ideas from our cultures. Our cultures guides us along in understanding what to strive towards and how to live happily. Three examples are food, language and holidays. Our cultural foods are typically healthy, as it's food that our predecessors have experimented over thousands of years. We can trust it. Language is also powerful. The values defined in our language show us what is important. In Han Chinese cultural value of filial piety (孝順) is important  and instructs the current generation to be respectful of previous generation's wisdom. Another point is our holidays. Native Americans have many holidays to pay their respects to nature, one of which is the Green Corn Festival in June. Various tribes care a lot about living in harmony with the earth. Our cultures are not always right but they are a set of tools our predecessors belive will help us live well. It's important that we do our share in shaping our cultures for those who come after us.

			<h2>Meaningful Relationships</h2>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				Empathy can improve our relationships with friends and loved ones. We all appreciate it when someone cares about us. Caring about someone involves observing them and knowing the intricacies about them. Listening is everything. If someone mentions they love French food but have never been to a French restaurant, take them there. If someone drops offhandedly that they're looking for internships, ask if you can help. If someone's home right now and they don't enjoy being at home, ask them how it's going. If someone loves Germany and you end up visiting Germany, grab a souvenir for them. If someone loves books, find some you think would be good for them. If someone's more introverted, include them in events. If someone's more extroverted, thank them for organizing events. If someone winces at something, ask if they are alright. If someone says <i>I'm fine</i>, ask if they are actually fine. If someone is waiting for their food, wait with them if your order comes first. If someone is quiet in a group setting, ask if something is on their mind. 
			</div>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				There are no hard and fast rules. However, it's important to explain you actions. Letting others know the intentions behind your actions shows them that you are coming from a place of care, not hostility.
			</div>
			<h2>Driver of Change Throughout History</h2>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				Empathy is the driver of change throughout history. It's the reason, though begrudgingly, that we've given equal rights to minorities or infringed groups.
			</div>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				Let's first look at Martin Luther King Jr (1929-1968). Dr. King was a civil rights activist who fought to end segregation of African Americans within America. He believed strongly in nonviolent tactics. Dr. King led a campaign in Birmingham, Alabama in 1963. Activists wanted to desegregate Birmingham. At the time, the unemployment rate and average incomes were 2.5 times higher and 50% lower than for blacks than for whites respectively. Birmingham didn't have any blacks in various public sectors (police officers, firefighters or bus drivers) and were often restricted to blue collar work. Dr. King led protests against the Birmingham Police Department under Eugene Connor who was the Commisioner of Public Safety. 
			</div>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				Police officers used police dogs and high pressure water jets against protestors. Their extreme response was captured by national media outlets. It brought more black support to the civil rights movement and shocked white Americans. Graphic footage of black Americans being attacked led more white American support. They were empathetic to this problem and transitioned away from thinking <i>this is the way the world works</i> to thinking <i>nobody should have to fight so hard for basic rights</i>.
			</div>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				That story continues to play out in other ways like African Americans being able to vote (Voting Rights Act of 1965), LGBTQ marriage being approved in all fifty states (Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015), or the H1-B visa (Immigration Act of 1990). Our world becomes a little better when we remove barriers for others to opportunities we have so that we can create a better place together.
			</div>
			<h2>Present Day</h2>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				We need empathy more than ever. We need empathy to understand everyone's hardships and prevent ourselves from being radicalized to two extremes.
