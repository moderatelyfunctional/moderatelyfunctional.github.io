				Empathy is the ability to understand and share the emotions of others. Empathy is a very human part of ourselves. In a world where our value systems are centered around physical, social, economic, or knowledge capital, empathy is unrecognized. However, empathy is deeply important to our individual lives and is a silent driver of key events throughout history and the present day.

			<h2>Why Empathy?</h2>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				Empathy is not only about caring for others. It's also about others caring for us. It's a mirror. If we care for others, they will care for us. If we don't care for others, they won't care for us. Imagine that we have the following Prisoner's Dilemma chart where `C`  and `D` denote care and don't care respectively. The scores correspond to our levels of happiness.

				If two parties mutually care about each other, then their interaction score is 2. If they both don't care about each other, then their interaction score is 1. The benefits of empathy are readily apparent for long-term interactions. Even for short-term interactions, empathy is important. That's because the other party can convey their interaction experiences with you to others. If others know you don't have a tendency to care, they won't be as willing to care in their interactions with you, even for first-time interactions.
			</div>
			<h2>Workplace Empathy</h2>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				Empathy is very important whenever you have to work with others. Let's assume that you work on a backend payments API team at a tech company. The API is served by dedicated Rails servers and your team is transitioning the API to a more modern microservices approach. It's important for you to have buy-in from your team. If various teammates have spent a lot of time previously working on the Rails server, it's understandable that they're apprehensive about throwing out all of their work. It's important that you incorporate the work that they've done into the microservices approach. Are there concessions you can make? Can you also write the microservices approach in Ruby? Can you take the same payments authentication or fraud detection approach they went with? Can you put them in charge of porting their code over? Empathy here is very important in showing your teammates that you care about them so that they want to work with you. It's very important to outline the work your teammates have done on the Rails server when you're presenting your work to the rest of the company. They will appreciate it and support you in the future.
			</div>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				Empathy is also important when you're advocating for others. Imagine you're working at a consulting firm and you're building a product presentation for new enterprise clients. You're again on a team with a few team members. You mention in a meeting that another teammate, Josh, did excellent research that should be incorporated on one of the slides. Someone else on the team doesn't want to because it would detract away from research that he did but you don't budge and the research makes its way into the slides. After the meeting, Josh finds you and thanks you for speaking up for him. Your team shows the clients the presentation, and they love it. They even point to Josh's research which reassured them that working with your company was the right move. Your teammates applaud you and Josh. 
			</div>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				The data also shows empathy is crucial to the workplace. Nathan Podsakoff of the University of Arizona analyzed 38 studies of workplace outcomes across organizations in engineering, medical school, and business sales. There were 3,500 units across the studies. The research showed that the worst performers measured by productivity, exam scores or sales revenue were givers, or individuals with a tendency to help others. They identified strongly with statements like <i>I love to help others</i>. However, the best performers were also givers. They were also very driven to help others.

			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				Empathy is beneficial, but it can come at a cost in the workplace. That cost can be reduced through various approaches. Explaining the nuance around that is not within the scope of this post but is explained in <a class="underline-a" href="https://www.adamgrant.net/give-and-take">Give And Take</a> by Adam Grant.

			<h2>Personal Empathy</h2>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				Empathy is an important part of our personal lives. If we were to revisit the Prisoner's Dilemma diagram, the score for mutual collaboration would be more higher because the interactions are richer. It's all about the subtleties. Friends who care about each other want to spend more time together and support each other more.

				Close friendships revolve around the intimacy of knowing that both parties are understood and accepted. I have a friend who's working abroad in Germany next year. They've always wanted to go to Germany and I'm excited that they're flying there now. They're very research oriented and we've had discussions about whether research (PhD) or industry was the right choice for them. We've also discussed my thoughts on technology and its role in shaping society. I cherish our friendship because I know we can simply be ourselves around each other.
			</div>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				Empathy is also critical for family. I come home to visit a few times a year, and when I came back recently, mom told me that she sprained herself lifting heavy objects. Right now she can't lift her arms over her head. I looked around the house and found a broomstick. I showed her some physical therapy exercises she should do with the broomstick. One good exercise is holding onto it with both arms and lifting it as high as possible. We worked on improving her form. Although it may take a while longer for her to completely recover, she's on the right track.
			</div>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				Love is an area where empathy shines. Caring for your partner requires methodical thought. I'll come back to my parents who  moved from a rural village to New York City. Dad works at a restaurant, delivering orders. When he comes home, he comes through the basement door and takes a shower. He then changes his clothes before coming up. He wants to protect my mom from coronavirus. Although the science here isn't completely clear, him doing so would definitely clear up any pathogens on his body. Dad also does the dishes and cooks for mom whenever he has a day off from work. 
			</div>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				Mom always stocks the refrigerator with food so that dad is never hungry. She prepares watermelons by scooping up a ten pound watermelon into plastic jars that we store. She also prepares a very healthy breakfast. It would make any healthcare professional beam. The dish contains rice mixed with eight different nuts and seeds. She also works in the restaurant to help my dad when it's a busy day. Mom also buys clothing for dad because his sense of fashion has not kept up with the times. She's sacrificed her career to take care of my through my middle school and high school years. 
			</div>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				The care that keeps the love intact. Over the years, they've had their share of arguments, but they've resolved their differences because the love is there.
			</div>
			<h2>Societal Empathy</h2>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				Empathy is the silent driver of change throughout history. It's the reason for instance, though reluctantly, that we've given equal rights to minorities or infringed groups. 
			</div>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				Let's first look at Martin Luther King Jr (1929-1968). Dr. King was a civil rights activist who fought to end segregation of African Americans within America. He believed strongly in nonviolent tactics. Dr. King led a campaign in Birmingham, Alabama in 1963. Activists wanted to desegregate Birmingham. At the time, the unemployment rate and average incomes were 2.5 times higher 50% lower than for blacks than for whites. Birmingham didn't have any blacks in various public sectors (police officers, firefighters or bus drivers) and were often restricted to blue collar work. Dr. King led protests against the Birmingham Police Department under Eugene Connor who was the Commisioner of Public Safety. 
			</div>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				Police officers used police dogs and high pressure water jets against protesters. Their extreme response was captured by national media outlets. It brought more black support to the civil rights movement and shocked white Americans. Graphic footage of black Americans being attacked led more white American support. They were empathetic to this problem and transitioned away from thinking <i>this is the way the world works</i> to thinking <i>nobody should have to fight so hard for basic rights</i>.
			</div>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				That story continues to play out in other ways like African Americans being able to vote (Voting Rights Act of 1965), LGBTQ marriage being approved in all fifty states (Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015), or the H1-B visa (Immigration Act of 1990). Our world becomes a little better when we remove barriers for others to opportunities we have so that we can create a better place together.
			</div>
			<h2>Practicing Empathy</h2>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				We all have the capacity to care. Empathy comes from a willingness to listen. That willingness only comes when believing that everyone deserves care. Empathy is hard so ways to practice it are outlined below.
			</div>
			<h3>Advocating For Others</h3>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				Somewhat related, but you can also advocate for others. Statements like <i>Josh did some excellent research, and we should put that in the slides, Meg is knowledgeable about backend payments. Meg, what do you think about moving our system to a microservices approach</i> are good. Sometimes, if someone is quiet, even a simple statement like <i>you're quiet today. Is there anything you'd like to say or do</i> may be helpful.
			</div>
			<h3>Thanking Others</h3>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				Thanking the service workers who help us carry about our days is important. Thanking everyone from servers, cashiers, teachers etc is very helpful. The most applicable to everyone is probably restaurant servers. You can increase your tip, thank the server, finish your food, or organize the plates for faster cleanup. 
			</div>
			<h3>Remember The Details</h3>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				Empathy is all about the details. If your partner mentions she hasn't had Italian food in a while, take her there. If your mom likes flowers, buy her some. If your friend enjoys movie soundtracks, grab them some albums they might appreciate. There are no hard and fast rules, because everyone is different. However, it's important to preface what you're doing to them. <i>I know you like flowers, so here are some</i> is both good communication and care. Explaining yourself removes any room for misunderstandings.
			</div>
			<h3>Listen</h3>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				Take the time to listen. Pretend that you're a care worker and your role is to understand the situation completely. Don't try and interject. Ask statements to understand their mindset: <i>how did that make you feel, why did you do that, what do you think about the situation now, how are you processing it, how can I best help</i>. 
			</div>
			<h3>Say Sorry</h3>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				We all make mistakes. It's likely that both parties are to blame, and we become too angry at the other party to sincerely apologize. It's important to apologize. There are five languages of apology: expressing regret, accepting responsibility, making restitution, genuinely repenting, requesting forgiveness. For more information, check out Monica's <a class="underline-a" href="https://verilymag.com/2016/08/5-love-languages-how-to-apologize-properly-5-languages-of-apology">article</a>. Here's how they look.

				<p><i>I regret doing X because it makes you sad and I am sorry.</i></p>

				<p><i>I made a mistake. This was my fault and I'm sorry.</i></p>

				<p><i>I'm sorry I made you sad due to Y. I love you and I'll do A, B, C to make it up to you.</i></p>

				<p><i>I'm sorry I did this. I love you and I will never put do it again.</i></p>

				<p><i>I'm sorry I made this mistake. Can you forgive me? I will work on being better.</i></p>
			</div>
			<h3>Incorporate Feedback</h3>
			<div class="thought-paragraph">
				People appreciate it if you involve them in decision-making. <i>What do you think we should do, I'm sorry for this, how can I do better, you're very knowledgeable about A and I would appreciate your thoughts right now</i> are good ways to start.
